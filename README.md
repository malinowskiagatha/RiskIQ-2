***Task #1: Calculating Risk Metrics***
- VaR
- CVaR
- Volatility

***Task #2: SQL Lite***
- Fill in the SQL table by iterating over the rows, and inserting the data in the table.

***Task #3: Nested List Logic***
- Compute and return the sum of all the numbers in the nested list based on the following checks:
  -  If the index of an inner-list is even, you must double all values starting from (and including) the first occurrence of the                number 9 in that list all the way to (and including) the next occurrence of the number 6 in the remainder of that list. 
  -  If the index of an inner list is odd, you must triple all the values starting from (and including) the first occurrence of the number      7 in that list all the way to (and including) the next occurrence of the number 4 in the remainder of that list. 
  -  Then, once you have a single list of values which were obtained from each inner-list, you must ignore any values in that list              starting from (and including) the first occurrence of the number 4 all the way to (and including) the next occurrence of the number 5      in the remainder of the list.
  - If there is no end marker (6, 4, 5) after a start marker (9, 7, 4), you must return the normal sum of the list.
